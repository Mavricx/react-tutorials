# React Conventions

1. **Capitalize** the first letter of file and component names (e.g., `MyComponent.jsx`).
2. Use the `.jsx` extension for files containing JSX code.
3. Apply **PascalCase** for component names and **camelCase** for functions and variables.
4. Place **one component per file** to improve maintainability.
5. Prefer **functional components and hooks** over class components.
6. Keep components **small and focused** on a single responsibility.
7. **Group related files** (components, styles, tests) within the same folder.
8. Use **PropTypes** or **TypeScript** for type checking.
9. Avoid using the **index as a key** in lists unless necessary.
10. Write **clear and descriptive commit messages** for changes.
